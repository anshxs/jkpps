                Lyceum International School was founded in 1993 with only 
                seven students and four teachers by visionary educator, 
                Honourable Dr. Mohan Lal Grero to provide English medium 
                education from Pre-school to Grade 12. Since then, Lyceum 
                International School has come a long way with multiple 
                branches spread out across the island â€“ a testament to our high-quality education and passion for teaching.

                  problems with quiet strength and wisdom. They face both
